# Prototype3 Enhancements - Multi-API Integration

## What's New

I've significantly expanded the data collection capabilities by integrating **8 different data sources** (up from 1).

## New APIs Integrated

### 1. Census API ✅
**Purpose**: District demographics for understanding voter base

**Data Collected**:

- Median household income
- College education rates
- Demographic breakdowns

**Why It Matters**:
- Identifies districts with high youth voter turnout potential
- Shows economic characteristics of voter base
- Helps understand district competitiveness

**Implementation**: Fetches data for 20+ districts (configurable to all 435)

---

### 2. Wikipedia API ✅
**Purpose**: Candidate biographical information

**Data Collected**:
